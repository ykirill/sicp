Chapter "Building Abstractions with Procedures".

Exercise 1.4

Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions.
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
        ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

Answer:

Procedure's name: a-plus-abs-b;
Arguments:        a, b;

When the procedure had arguments, it computes the predicate (> b 0).
Then, if the result is true, it computes a + b, otherwise a - b.
